          This particular project consisted of three people total, two raspberry pis, an iOS app and an LED strip. The project used machine learning to determine the color of an RGB LED controlled  strip by an iPhone App and a Raspberry Pi. We put the RGB LED strip inside a laser cut lamp (see below for the picture) The user determined what color the lamp should be based on differen  t   temperatures, wind speeds, and weather conditions (i.e. Partly Cloudy) by selecting different colors in the iPhone App. After the user had entered a small set of data points (currently 5)    the lamp is ready to be turned on. The confidence of the color of the lamp is displayed to user as "Confident" or "Not Confident" depending on how similar the current weather is to weathe r    in the training data. The user had the ability to add training points and retrain the algorithm. This project was a great learning experience because I gained knowledge on hardware,  software and machine learning.

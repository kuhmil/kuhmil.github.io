      <h3>Sound Reactive Infinity Table</h3>


      <section class="projects-des">

        <p class="contact-list">

          This project was continuation of the Sound Reactive Christmas Tree. I initially wanted to create a display case for the lego millenium falcon. I then though about how I could make the display light up and reactive. At the time I didn't have a coffee table in my place so I thought why not make a table to display the millenium falcon as well as making it reactive. Once the table was bullt I installed an infinity mirror on the base of a coffee table that was sound reactive. With the use of an Arduino, the color of the LEDs would turn on when the sound sensor picked up on noise. LEDs would change colors when there were different frequencies

      <h3>Interactive Weather Lamp</h3>


      <section class="projects-des">

        <p class="contact-list">

          This particular project consisted of three people total, two raspberry pis, an iOS app and an LED strip. The project used machine learning to determine the color of an RGB LED controlled  strip by an iPhone App and a Raspberry Pi. We put the RGB LED strip inside a laser cut lamp (see below for the picture) The user determined what color the lamp should be based on differen  t   temperatures, wind speeds, and weather conditions (i.e. Partly Cloudy) by selecting different colors in the iPhone App. After the user had entered a small set of data points (currently 5)    the lamp is ready to be turned on. The confidence of the color of the lamp is displayed to user as "Confident" or "Not Confident" depending on how similar the current weather is to weathe r    in the training data. The user had the ability to add training points and retrain the algorithm. This project was a great learning experience because I gained knowledge on hardware,  software and machine learning.

      <h3>Christmas Carols</h3>

      <section class="projects-des">

        <p class="contact-list">

          I had wanted to create this project for a while but I didn't have the time or the space. With the use of an Arduino, the color of the LEDs would turn on when the sound sensor picked up on noise. Depending one what frequecies were picked up a cetain part of the tree lit up. It was split into tiers. The first tier would pick up on the rartist singing the lyrics, the second ties would react when lighter beats played. The third tier would light up with heavier beats.
